I'm Bhavy Doshi from India and I recently joined the MCDA program in the Fall 2023 cohort after working for 5 years in TCS and Barclays Bank perming the role of auditor and developer. My banner ID is A00878485 and you can reach me by email at Bhavy.Doshi@smu.ca

I went on a solo trip to New Delhi in Dec'2022 and interesting fact about the trip is that I didn't have any booking or any plan 6 hours prior to the flight. I booked the hotel 5 hours ago and made the list of places to visit after reaching New Delhi. I roamed around in New Delhi for 3 days and decided to join the open group who were travelling to Manali & Kasol and had a lots of fun.
