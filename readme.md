I went on a solo trip to New Delhi in Dec'2022 and interesting fact about the trip is that I didn't have any booking or any plan 6 hours prior to the flight. I booked the hotel 5 hours ago and made the list of places to visit after reaching New Delhi. I roamed around in New Delhi for 3 days and decided to join the open group who were travelling to Manali & Kasol and had a lots of fun.

Northern lights are one of the few things which are present in bucket list and I wish to see it in the winter. I googled the facts and points about Halifax and found an interesteing fact that we can see in during peak winter but I'm also willing to travel just to see it. Northern lights are formed when charged particles collide with gases in Earth's upper atmosphere.
